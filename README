Instructions for downloading a proof editor for natural deduction
proofs in propositional logic.

It is assumed that one works under Linux (Windows users should contact me 
for instructions).

The system is implemented in Haskell and designed to run
with interactive Haskell, ghci, which is included in
the distribution of GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler).
It uses latex for displaying proof trees.

It strongly recommended to run Haskell from the text editor emacs.

In the Linux lab, Haskell, latex, and emacs are available.

Download the file proverfiles.zip
 
Unzip it:

unzip proverfiles.zip

This will create the directory prover containing
the Haskell code of the prover.

Move into that directory:

cd prover

How to use the prover is described in the USER-MANUAL.

Use the text editor emacs to read the USER-MANUAL and run the prover:

emacs&

For details on how to run the prover see the USER-MANUAL.
